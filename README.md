# FI-Data-Mining

The primary objective of the project was to develop software that allows Fischer International Identity, an Identity Access and Management company, to find similarities in the attributes of certain records in their data sets, group them, and extract useful information. To accomplish this, data mining, specifically association rule learning, was used, and the process is facilitated through a graphical user interface. The project also features a full suite of automated unit and integration tests to achieve 90% or greater branch and statement coverage.
